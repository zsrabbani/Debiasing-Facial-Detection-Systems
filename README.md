# Debiasing-Facial-Detection-Systems
I investigated one recently published approach to addressing algorithmic bias. I built a facial detection model that learns the latent variables underlying face image datasets and uses this to adaptively re-sample the training data, thus mitigating any biases that may be present in order to train a debiased model.
